Neural Network Model for Football Data
A neural network model was implemented to predict football match outcomes using a variety of features such as team statistics and player performances. 
The model was trained and evaluated, achieving a reasonable accuracy. However, 
there is potential for improvement through fine-tuning the hyperparameters and expanding the dataset for better generalization.

Improvements:
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization could reduce overfitting.
- Inclusion of additional relevant features may enhance model performance.

Business Value:
- The model provides valuable predictive insights that can assist clubs and analysts in making data-driven decisions.
- It can be used to optimize team strategies, improve player performance evaluation, and enhance scouting efficiency.
- Over time, as new data is added, the model will improve, offering continuous value to football clubs.
